# climbing_paris / Work in progress

The aim of this repository consists in showing how to build, visualize and reproduce accessibility indicators by combining points of interest (POI) coming from the OpenStreetMap database, socio-economic indicators included in small territorial division (IRIS) and routing engines (OSRM).

The graphical outputs displayed in this notebook are also available in an Observable collection.

It is applied to sport climbing in Paris, but this example could be easily extended to other areas of interest or other amenities (OpenStreetMap key-values).

To introduce the reader to the issues raised by indoor sport-climbing in Paris, have a look to this notebook.

This Quarto document combines 2 computer languages : R for data processing, and D3.js for data visualizations.

The online methodological document is available [here](https://rysebaert.github.io/climbing_paris/)
The Observable collection is available [here](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rysebaert/climbing_paris)
